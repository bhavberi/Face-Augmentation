### Problem Statement

_Face and Photograph Augmentation based on a Custom Theme_

### Introduction

Face and photograph augmentation are a form of  expression, communication and entertainment. Applying a mask on oneâ€™s face is surprising and fun and may also be considered artistic. We present a technique to make any photographed or animated face into a mask and an automated algorithm to apply masks on top of faces. To complete the resulting image, it is possible to apply gradual blur and vignetting and change the color temperature of the photograph.

### Progress so far!

- Face Detection: 
    - [x] Using the `Haar Cascade Classifier` to detect faces in an image.
    - [x] Segmenting the face, and smoothening it for further use.
    - [x] Getting the facial landmarks.

- Special Instagram-like Effects:
    - [x] Gradient blurring
    - [x] Vignetting
    - [x] Changing the Color Temperature
